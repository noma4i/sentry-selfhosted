    What does this test do?
    This test is responsible for ensuring that a collection of
    taskbroker consumers only writes a single task to sqlite
    once during a rebalancing storm.

    How does it accomplish this?
    Firstly, the topic is created with a set number of partitions (e.g. 32).
    After a set number of messages are sent to kafka, the test starts N number
    of taskbroker consumers (e.g. 8). These consumers will consume messages
    from kafka and write to sqlite in parallel. At random, the test then sends
    a SIGINT to each consumer, which will trigger a rebalancing event. This
    process continues until all tasks have been written to sqlite. By using the
    task's offset, we validate that all tasks have been written to sqlite
    only once.
