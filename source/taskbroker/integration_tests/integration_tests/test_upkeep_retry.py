def test_upkeep_retry() -> None:
    """
    What does this test do?
    This tests is responsible for checking the integrity of the retry
    mechanism implemented in the upkeep thread of taskbroker. An initial
    amount of messages is produced to kafka with a set number of retries
    in its retry policy. Then, the taskworkers fetch and update the
    task's status to retry. During an interval, the upkeep thread will
    collect these tasks and re-produce the task to kafka. This process
    continues until all tasks have been retried the specified number of times.

    How does it accomplish this?
    The test starts N number of taskworker(s) and a taskbroker in separate
    threads. Synchronization events are use to instruct the taskworker(s)
    when start processing and shutdown. A shared data structured access by
    a mutex called TaskRetriedCounter is used to globally keep track of
    every task retried. Finally, this total number is validated alongside the
    number of times each individual task was retried.
