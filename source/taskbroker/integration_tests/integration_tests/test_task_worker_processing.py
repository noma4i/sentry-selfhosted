    What does this test do?
    This tests is responsible for ensuring that all tasks sent to taskbroker
    are processed and completed by taskworker only once. An initial
    amount of messages is produced to kafka. Then, mock taskworkers fetches
    and completes the task (without actually running the activation).
    This process continues until all tasks have been completed only once.

    How does it accomplish this?
    To accomplish this, the test starts N number of taskworker(s) and a
    taskbroker in separate. threads. Synchronization events are use to
    instruct the taskworker(s) when start processing and shutdown.
    A shared dictionary accessed by a mutex is used to collect duplicate
    processed tasks. Finally, the total number of fetched and completed
    tasks are compared to the number of messages sent to taskbroker.
