    What does this test do?
    This tests is responsible for checking the integrity of the expires_at
    mechanism responsible for removing tasks. This
    functionality is executed in the upkeep thread of taskbroker.
    An initial amount of messages with an expiry of 3 seconds are produced to
    kafka. During an interval, the upkeep thread collect all tasks that have
    expired, and remove them from the activation store. This process continues
    until all tasks have been purged.

    How does it accomplish this?
    The test starts 1 taskworker thread. Once the upkeep thread
    has successfully completed all messages in sqlite, taskbroker shuts down.
    Finally, this total number of completed messages and messages in the DLQ
    topic is validated.
