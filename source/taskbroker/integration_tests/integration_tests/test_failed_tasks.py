    What does this test do?
    This tests is responsible for ensuring that failed tasks are properly
    handled by taskbroker. When these tasks are failed, taskbroker is
    responsible for discarding or deadlettering the task according to
    the task's configuration. This occurs in the upkeep thread.

    How does it accomplish this?
    To accomplish this, the test starts a taskworker and a taskbroker in
    separate threads. Synchronization events are used to instruct the
    taskworker when start processing and shutdown. The taskworker will
    purposely fail to process a task and set it to a failed state.
    During the upkeep interval, the upkeep thread will appropriately
    discard and deadletter tasks. Finally, the total number of
    discarded and deadlettered tasks are validated.
